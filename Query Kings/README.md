## Project

**Schema Kings** — From feature spec to insight: agents that instrument ClickHouse, keep business context fresh, analyze warehouse data, and explain results for a product audience — fully traced in Langfuse.

## What it does

Atlys ships product fast; every feature still needs instrumentation, schema design, and analysis, and context gets lost across handoffs.

We collapse that loop into one agentic pipeline on ClickHouse:

1. **Instrumentation Agent** — takes a feature spec (`spec.md` + `events.ndjson`) → Bronze audit → LLM schema design/critic with guardrails → Silver tables → Gold MVs
2. **Context Agent** — writes a living context layer in ClickHouse (`context.*`) only after Silver validation; surfaces contradictions and gaps
3. **Analytics Agent** — answers PM questions with warehouse-backed SQL, numbers-first insights, confidence, and an evidence critic
4. **Tracing + visualization** — every run is traced in Langfuse; a report UI (`cli serve`) shows schema over time, insights, and context changelog

Hybrid trust model: LLMs draft intent, plans, SQL, and prose; deterministic code retrieves context, blocks mutating SQL, executes ClickHouse, validates loads, and strips unsupported claims.

All dataset content is **synthetic**. No real customer data or PII.

## Hosted Demo

<!-- TODO: replace with your live URL -->

**[Live demo](YOUR_HOSTED_DEMO_URL)** — report UI with Ask box, instrumented features, context changelog, and Langfuse deep-links.

The demo covers:

- End-to-end instrumentation of feature specs
- Analytics Agent answers (including the standard probe prompts)
- Context freshness (before/after when a new table lands)
- Langfuse traces for pipeline + ask runs (6th-spec trace mandatory)

## How to run it

**Full setup + the one end-to-end command:** see [`RUN.md`](./RUN.md).

### Supported platforms

| Platform                                  | Local one-command (`./run-local.sh`) | Notes                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **macOS**                                 | Supported                            | Primary path we develop on                           |
| **Linux**                                 | Supported                            | Same bash + Docker Compose flow                      |
| **Windows (WSL2)**                        | Supported                            | Run inside WSL + Docker Desktop with WSL integration |
| **Windows (PowerShell / CMD / Git Bash)** | **Not supported**                    | Native Windows will not work — use WSL2              |

This is **not** macOS-only. `brew …` lines below are macOS shortcuts; on Linux/WSL use the generic installers instead.

`./run-local.sh` checks prerequisites up front (Docker running, Compose, Node 22+, pnpm, `.env` keys) and exits with a clear error if something is missing.

After prerequisites and `backend/.env` are ready:

```bash
cd source_code
./run-local.sh
```

Reset local Docker + artifacts anytime:

```bash
cd source_code
./clean-local.sh
./run-local.sh
```

### Prerequisites (local)

No host ClickHouse client / `brew install clickhouse` for local — Docker provides ClickHouse.

| **Bash / WSL** (Windows)                       | `run-local.sh` is bash                           | [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)                                                                |

Cloud Parquet load is separate — see [`RUN.md`](./RUN.md) (host `clickhouse` client only then).

Verify:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
node --version   # v22+ recommended
pnpm --version
```

Then open [`RUN.md`](./RUN.md) and follow local (or Cloud) setup from `source_code/`.
